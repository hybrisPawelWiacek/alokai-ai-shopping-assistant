## Executive Summary

This guide provides the complete implementation plan for the Alokai UDL-Powered AI Shopping Assistant. It supersedes the original implementation plan by incorporating key discoveries:

1. **Action Framework Pattern**: Configuration-driven tools as the core innovation
2. **Commerce Intelligence Layer**: The true competitive differentiator
3. **LangGraph as Infrastructure**: Orchestration is commodity, intelligence is the moat
4. **Tool Factory Pattern**: The optimal LangGraph pattern for the action framework

**Important**: This is a **greenfield implementation**. The existing `ai-assistant` feature is just a PoC, allowing us to build the ideal solution without legacy constraints. We start with production-quality patterns from day one.

**Critical Discovery (January 2025)**:
- **UDL Integration Missing**: PROMPTS 1-12 implemented without proper UDL integration
- **Root Cause**: Implementation focused on AI patterns over Alokai's core architecture
- **Impact**: Search, product details, B2B operations all non-functional
- **Resolution**: v3.0 adds UDL-First approach with remediation prompts

**Additional Discovery (January 2025)**:
- **Mock Replacement Needed**: After implementing frontend (PROMPT 19), discovered extensive use of UDL-compliant mocks
- **Impact**: System works but uses fake data instead of real commerce data
- **Resolution**: Added PROMPTS 20-22 to connect real UDL before production

**Verification Process Started (June 2025)**:
- **Goal**: Systematically verify and improve all prompt implementations
- **Method**: Two-phase approach - Planning then Implementation for each prompt
- **Focus**: Ensure UDL compliance, fix issues, enhance features
- **Version**: v4.0 - Comprehensive Verification Pass

## Verification Process Guidelines (June 2025)

### Overview
Each prompt verification follows a two-phase approach to ensure quality while building on existing work:

### Phase 1: Planning Mode
1. **Review Original Requirements**: Read the prompt details from this guide
2. **Analyze Current Implementation**: 
   - Check actual code files for what was built
   - Compare against ARCHITECTURE_AND_PATTERNS.md patterns
   - Note any deviations from UDL-First principles
3. **Identify Gaps and Improvements**:
   - Missing features from original requirements
   - UDL integration issues (using mocks instead of real SDK)
   - Code quality improvements
   - Test coverage gaps
4. **Create Verification Plan**: Document what needs to be:
   - Kept as-is (working correctly)
   - Fixed (bugs or issues)
   - Enhanced (improvements)
   - Added (missing features)

### Phase 2: Implementation Mode
1. **Execute Verification Plan**: Make improvements while preserving working code
2. **Ensure UDL Compliance**: Replace any mocks with real SDK calls where possible
3. **Update Tests**: Add or fix tests to match implementation
4. **Update Documentation**: If implementation differs from docs in `features/ai-shopping-assistant/docs/`
5. **Mark as Verified**: Update status in this table with date

### Documentation Sources
- **Primary Guides** (use these for implementation):
  - This IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md - The plan
  - ARCHITECTURE_AND_PATTERNS.md - Technical patterns
  - LEARNINGS_AND_ISSUES.md - Known issues
- **Ground Truth**: Actual code files
- **Outputs to Verify**: `features/ai-shopping-assistant/docs/` files

### Verification Checklist Template
For each prompt:
- [ ] Original requirements reviewed
- [ ] Current implementation analyzed
- [ ] UDL compliance verified
- [ ] Tests present and passing
- [ ] Documentation accurate
- [ ] Status updated to "âœ“ Verified"

## Core Architecture Vision

```typescript
// The conceptual breakthrough: Tools ARE the configuration
// Commerce operations become a configuration concern, not a code concern

interface AlokaiCommerceArchitecture {
  // Layer 0: Data Access - ALWAYS through UDL (The Foundation)
  dataAccess: {
    products: UDL.products;      // NOT direct API calls
    inventory: UDL.inventory;    // NOT mock services
    pricing: UDL.pricing;        // NOT hardcoded values
    cart: UDL.cart;             // NOT custom implementations
    customer: UDL.customer;      // NOT fake data
    // ALL commerce data flows through UDL
  };
  
  // Layer 1: Configuration-Driven Tools (The Innovation)
  actions: Map<string, ActionDefinition>;
  
  // Layer 2: Commerce Intelligence (The Moat - Powered by UDL's Speed)
  intelligence: {
    modeDetection: B2CB2BEngine;
    contextEnrichment: CommerceContext;
    intentPrediction: PatternEngine;
    securityLayer: SecurityJudge;  // Built-in from start
  };
  
  // Layer 3: LangGraph Orchestration (The Infrastructure)
  orchestration: StateGraph<CommerceState, CommerceState>;
  
  // Layer 4: Observability (Production-Ready)
  monitoring: {
    performance: PerformanceTracker;
    security: ThreatMonitor;
    business: MetricsCollector;
  };
}

// Validated LangGraph Pattern
import { MessagesAnnotation } from "@langchain/langgraph";
import { ToolNode } from "@langchain/langgraph/prebuilt";

// State definition using MessagesAnnotation.spec
const CommerceStateAnnotation = Annotation.Root({
  ...MessagesAnnotation.spec,
  mode: Annotation<"b2c" | "b2b">()
    .reducer((_, next) => next ?? "b2c"),
  // Additional commerce-specific state...
});
```

## UDL Integration Requirements

**CRITICAL**: Every prompt must enforce UDL-First principles:

### UDL Integration Checklist (For Every Prompt)
â–¡ Does this use UDL for ALL data access?
â–¡ Are there any direct API calls? (RED FLAG)
â–¡ Do the types extend from UDL types?
â–¡ Is the mock aligned with UDL structure?
â–¡ Are custom extensions properly defined in middleware?

### Why UDL Matters
1. **Consistency**: UDL provides consistent data structure regardless of backend
2. **Performance**: UDL's optimizations give us the <50ms advantage
3. **Flexibility**: Can switch backends without changing AI assistant code
4. **Intelligence**: Commerce Intelligence Layer depends on UDL's unified view
5. **Maintenance**: One place to update when backends change

### Correct vs Incorrect Patterns

```typescript
// CORRECT: All data through UDL
class SearchProductsAction {
  async execute(params: SearchParams, context: Context) {
    // Use UDL for unified access
    const products = await context.sdk.unified.searchProducts({
      search: params.query,
      filter: params.filters
    });
    
    // UDL handles backend differences
    const inventory = await context.sdk.unified.checkInventory(
      products.map(p => p.id)
    );
    
    return this.enrichWithInventory(products, inventory);
  }
}

// INCORRECT: Direct backend calls or mocks
class WrongSearchAction {
  async execute(params: SearchParams) {
    // DON'T DO THIS - bypasses UDL
    const products = await fetch('/api/sap/products');
    // This breaks Alokai's architecture!
    
    // ALSO WRONG - using non-existent methods
    const products = await sdk.commerce.getProducts();
  }
}
```

## Key Implementation Patterns

### Tool Factory Pattern (Validated âœ…)
```typescript
class LangGraphActionFactory {
  createTool(action: ActionDefinition) {
    return tool(
      async (params, config) => {
        // Access current state
        const state = config.configurable?.getCurrentTaskInput?.();
        const context = state?.context;
        const mode = context?.mode || 'b2c';
        
        // Process with commerce intelligence
        const enrichedParams = action.preProcess?.(params, mode) ?? params;
        const result = await action.execute(enrichedParams, context);
        const enhanced = action.postProcess?.(result, mode) ?? result;
        
        // Return Command for state update
        return new Command({
          update: {
            lastAction: action.name,
            actionResults: enhanced
          }
        });
      },
      {
        name: action.name.toLowerCase(),
        description: action.description,
        schema: this.generateZodSchema(action.parameters)
      }
    );
  }
}
```

### State Definition Pattern (Validated âœ…)
```typescript
import { Annotation, MessagesAnnotation, Command } from "@langchain/langgraph";

const CommerceStateAnnotation = Annotation.Root({
  // Use prebuilt message handling
  ...MessagesAnnotation.spec,
  
  // Commerce-specific state
  mode: Annotation<"b2c" | "b2b">()
    .reducer((current, update) => update ?? current ?? "b2c"),
  
  cartState: Annotation<CartState>()
    .reducer((current, update) => {
      if (update instanceof Command) {
        return { ...current, ...update.update.cartState };
      }
      return update ?? current;
    }),
    
  // Performance tracking
  metrics: Annotation<PerformanceMetrics>()
});
```

### Graph Construction Pattern (Validated âœ…)
```typescript
import { StateGraph } from "@langchain/langgraph";
import { ToolNode } from "@langchain/langgraph/prebuilt";

const workflow = new StateGraph(CommerceStateAnnotation)
  .addNode("agent", agentNode)
  .addNode("tools", new ToolNode(tools))
  .addEdge(START, "agent")
  .addConditionalEdges("agent", shouldUseTool, {
    continue: "tools",
    end: END
  })
  .addEdge("tools", "agent");
  
const graph = workflow.compile();
```

## Version History

### v4.0 - Verification Pass (June 2025)

#### Executive Summary
Version 4.0 introduces a systematic verification process to ensure all implementations meet quality standards and properly integrate with UDL.

#### Key Changes
1. **Added Verification Process Guidelines**: Two-phase approach for each prompt
2. **Reset Implementation Status**: All prompts marked "To Verify" for systematic review
3. **Added Verification Date Column**: Track when each prompt is verified
4. **Clarified Documentation Sources**: Primary guides vs implementation results
5. **Added Verification Checklist**: Standardized approach for each prompt

#### Why These Changes
- Ensure all implementations properly use UDL
- Identify and fix any issues from original implementation
- Improve code quality and test coverage
- Validate documentation accuracy
- Provide clear audit trail of verification work

### v3.1 - Mock Replacement Prompts (January 2025)

#### Executive Summary
Version 3.1 adds three new prompts (20-22) to replace UDL-compliant mocks with real SDK integration before attempting production deployment.

#### Key Changes
1. **Added PROMPT 20**: Connect Core UDL Methods - Replace mock implementations with real SDK
2. **Added PROMPT 21**: Implement Custom Extensions - Create real B2B methods in middleware
3. **Added PROMPT 22**: Integration Testing - Verify everything works with real backend
4. **Deferred PROMPT 17**: Production Readiness moved after mock replacement

#### Why These Changes
- Frontend implementation revealed extensive use of mocks following UDL patterns
- System works but uses fake data instead of real commerce data
- Need to connect real backend before production deployment
- Ensures all features work with actual UDL before going live

### v3.0 - UDL-First Architecture (January 2025)

#### Executive Summary
Version 3.0 addresses the critical architectural oversight discovered in January 2025: **the AI Shopping Assistant was not properly integrated with Alokai's Unified Data Layer (UDL)**, which is Alokai's core competitive advantage.

#### Key Changes

1. **Title Change**
   - **From**: "AI Shopping Assistant LangGraph Implementation Plan"
   - **To**: "Alokai UDL-Powered AI Shopping Assistant Implementation Plan"
   - **Why**: Makes it crystal clear that UDL is not optional but foundational

2. **Architecture Reordering**
   Added **Layer 0: Data Access** as the foundation:
   ```typescript
   dataAccess: {
     products: UDL.products;      // NOT direct API calls
     inventory: UDL.inventory;    // NOT mock services
     pricing: UDL.pricing;        // NOT hardcoded values
     cart: UDL.cart;             // NOT custom implementations
     customer: UDL.customer;      // NOT fake data
   }
   ```

3. **New Remediation Prompts**
   - PROMPT 2: UDL Integration Audit
   - PROMPT 13: UDL Pattern Refactoring

4. **UDL Integration Checklist**
   Mandatory checklist for EVERY prompt

5. **Updated Key Design Principles**
   Added UDL-First as Principle 0 (highest priority)

6. **Prompt Updates**
   All prompts now explicitly require UDL integration

#### Why These Changes Matter
1. **UDL is Alokai's Moat**: Provides unified access to 20+ backends with <50ms performance
2. **Consistency**: Without UDL, we're just building another chatbot
3. **Flexibility**: Can switch backends without changing AI code
4. **Performance**: UDL's optimizations are crucial for meeting targets
5. **Maintenance**: One place to update when backends change

### v2.2 - Production-Ready Patterns
- Security and performance moved earlier in the process
- PoC learnings extraction added as first step
- B2B bulk operations elevated to core feature

## Conclusion

This UDL-First approach ensures the AI Shopping Assistant is deeply integrated with Alokai's core architecture, not just an add-on. The Unified Data Layer is THE foundational pattern that enables:
- Consistent commerce data across 20+ backends
- <50ms data access performance
- Backend flexibility without code changes
- True commerce intelligence through unified view

The key insights:
1. **UDL is Alokai's moat** - The AI assistant is valuable because it leverages UDL's unified commerce data
2. **Tools as configuration** - Transforms how commerce AI can be extended
3. **Commerce patterns over AI patterns** - This is an Alokai solution that uses AI, not an AI solution that happens to work with Alokai
4. **Mock replacement is critical** - The system must connect to real UDL before production (PROMPTS 20-22)

With v3.0 updates, we ensure:
- UDL integration from day one
- Remediation path for already-implemented prompts
- Security and performance built on UDL's foundation
- Patterns validated against both LangGraph.js and Alokai best practices
- Full type safety extending from UDL types
