## 🚨 Priority 1: Critical Platform Decisions (Must resolve in 24 hours)

### 1.1 Platform Positioning Decision
**Current State**: Deferred as "add-on vs component vs separate platform"  
**Why Critical**: Affects entire go-to-market, pricing, and development approach

**Decision Framework**:
```
IF enterprise pilots request deep integration → Component
IF market wants standalone AI solution → Separate Platform  
IF customers want progressive enhancement → Add-on
```

**Discussion Questions**:
- What signals from current customers indicate preference?
- What maximizes revenue potential?
- What aligns with Alokai's current sales motion?

**Decision Needed By**: Day 1 - Affects all messaging and development priorities

### 1.2 Monetization Model
**Current State**: Vague references to "enhancement vs new SKU"  
**Why Critical**: Determines pricing strategy and value messaging

**Options to Discuss**:
1. **Usage-Based**: Pay per AI interaction/conversation
2. **Tier-Based**: AI features as premium tier
3. **Value-Based**: % of conversion improvement
4. **Hybrid**: Base fee + usage

**Key Considerations**:
- Current Alokai pricing model compatibility
- Enterprise procurement preferences  
- Competitive pricing landscape
- Infrastructure cost model

**Decision Needed By**: Day 2 - Required for pilot discussions

## 📊 Priority 2: Technical Reality Checks (Resolve in 48 hours)

### 2.1 Performance Baseline Assessment
**Current State**: Assuming 200-250ms based on Klarna example  
**Why Critical**: False expectations could damage credibility

**Action Items**:
- [ ] Benchmark current Alokai infrastructure response times
- [ ] Test OpenAI API latency from your GCP regions
- [ ] Measure UDL query performance under load
- [ ] Calculate realistic end-to-end latency

**Questions to Answer**:
- What's our current P95 response time?
- Where are the actual bottlenecks?
- Is 200-250ms achievable with our infrastructure?
- What optimizations are required?

**Decision Needed**: Realistic performance targets for MVP

### 2.2 MVP Configuration Scope
**Current State**: "Configuration-driven everything" vision vs 12-week reality  
**Why Critical**: Sets expectations for launch capabilities

**Scope Options**:
1. **Minimal**: 5-10 pre-built actions, parameter tweaking only
2. **Moderate**: Business users can enable/disable actions via UI
3. **Ambitious**: Visual action builder with limited options

**Discussion Points**:
- What demonstrates the vision without overcommitting?
- What would wow a pilot customer?
- What's technically feasible in 12 weeks?

**Decision Needed By**: Day 2 - Drives Week 2-3 development

## 🤝 Priority 3: Strategic Boundaries (Resolve in 72 hours)

### 3.1 Open Source Strategy
**Current State**: Mentioned but boundaries unclear  
**Why Critical**: Affects IP protection and community building

**Proposed Boundaries**:
```
OPEN SOURCE:
- Action framework patterns (drives adoption)
- LangGraph integration wrapper (commodity)
- Basic example actions

PROPRIETARY:
- Commerce Intelligence Layer (our moat)
- B2C/B2B detection algorithms
- Advanced action library
- Performance optimizations
```

**Questions to Resolve**:
- What license for open source components?
- How to protect commerce intelligence while building community?
- Timeline for open sourcing?

### 3.2 SAP Integration Depth for MVP
**Current State**: "How deep to go initially" undefined  
**Why Critical**: SAP is key partner but integration complexity could delay MVP

**MVP Options**:
1. **Surface**: SAP Commerce Cloud as another backend via existing integration
2. **Medium**: Special SAP-optimized actions and B2B flows  
3. **Deep**: Co-branded solution with SAP-specific features

**Factors to Consider**:
- SAP partnership agreements
- Technical complexity vs timeline
- Differentiation opportunity

**Decision Needed**: Specific SAP features for MVP

---

## 📈 Priority 4: Success Metrics Clarity (Define within 48 hours)

### 4.1 Baseline Metrics Needed
**Current State**: "20% conversion improvement" without baseline  
**Why Critical**: Can't measure success without starting point

**Metrics to Establish**:
- Current average conversion rate
- Current average order value  
- Current cart abandonment rate
- Current customer service costs
- Developer onboarding time

### 4.2 Pilot Success Criteria
**Current State**: Vague "success" definitions  
**Why Critical**: Need clear go/no-go for broader rollout

**Proposed Criteria**:
- [ ] 3 pilots live with >1000 conversations each
- [ ] >15% conversion improvement demonstrated
- [ ] <300ms P95 latency sustained
- [ ] 1 business user created custom action
- [ ] NPS >8 from pilot users

---

## 🔄 Priority 5: Competitive & Market Clarity (Address within 72 hours)

### 5.1 Unique Value Proposition Sharpening
**Current State**: "Commerce Intelligence Layer" is abstract  
**Why Critical**: Sales team needs concrete differentiators

**Questions to Answer**:
- What can we do that Shopify/BigCommerce AI can't?
- How is this different from ChatGPT plugins?
- Why is our B2C/B2B dual mode unique?
- What IP is truly defensible?

### 5.2 Defensive Strategy
**Current State**: No discussion of competitive response  
**Why Critical**: Major platforms will copy if successful

**Scenarios to Plan**:
- Shopify launches similar feature
- OpenAI creates commerce-specific model
- SAP builds their own solution
- Customers want to use own LLM
