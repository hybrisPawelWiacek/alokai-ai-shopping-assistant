## Getting Started

The AI Shopping Assistant helps your customers find products, manage their carts, and complete purchases through natural conversation. You can customize its behavior by configuring "actions" - specific tasks the assistant can perform.

### Key Benefits
- üõí Increased conversion rates through guided shopping
- üïí 24/7 customer support without additional staff
- üìä Valuable insights into customer behavior
- üîß Easy customization without coding

## Understanding Actions

Actions are the building blocks of the AI Assistant. Each action represents something the assistant can do, like:
- Search for products
- Add items to cart
- Check order status
- Compare products
- Generate quotes (B2B)

### Action Components
1. **Name**: What customers see (e.g., "Find Products")
2. **Description**: Helps the AI understand when to use this action
3. **Category**: Groups similar actions (search, cart, customer service)
4. **Parameters**: Information needed to complete the action

## Basic Configuration

### Simple Product Search Configuration

```yaml
# config/actions/search-products.yaml
name: "Product Search"
description: "Help customers find products in our catalog"
enabled: true

settings:
  maxResults: 20
  showOutOfStock: false
  defaultSort: "relevance"  # Options: relevance, price-low, price-high, newest

responses:
  noResults: "I couldn't find any products matching your search. Would you like to try different keywords?"
  tooManyResults: "I found many products! Here are the most relevant ones. You can refine your search by adding more details."
```

### Cart Management Configuration

```yaml
# config/actions/cart-management.yaml

```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Assistant Not Understanding Customers

**Problem**: Customers report the assistant doesn't understand their requests

**Solution**: Review and update action descriptions
```yaml
# Make descriptions more specific
# Bad:
description: "Handle products"

# Good:
description: "Search for products by name, category, brand, or features. Understands queries like 'blue running shoes', 'laptops under $1000', or 'waterproof jackets'"
```

#### Slow Response Times

**Problem**: Assistant takes too long to respond

**Solution**: Adjust performance settings
```yaml
performance:
  caching:
    enabled: true
    duration: 300  # 5 minutes
    
  searchOptimization:
    maxResults: 10  # Reduce from 50
    enableFacets: false  # Disable if not needed
    
  parallelQueries: true
  timeout: 5000  # 5 seconds max
```

#### Incorrect Product Recommendations

**Problem**: Assistant suggests irrelevant products

**Solution**: Fine-tune recommendation logic
```yaml
recommendations:
  relevanceThreshold: 0.7  # Increase from 0.5
  
  filters:
    excludeCategories: ["discontinued", "internal-use"]
    priceRange: "within-20-percent"
    onlyInStock: true
    
  weights:
    purchaseHistory: 0.4
    browsingHistory: 0.3
    categoryMatch: 0.2
    popularity: 0.1
```

### Testing Configuration Changes

Before applying changes to production:

1. **Use Test Mode**
```yaml
testMode:
  enabled: true
  testUsers: ["test@company.com", "qa-team@company.com"]
  logLevel: "debug"
```

2. **Gradual Rollout**
```yaml
rollout:
  strategy: "percentage"
  stages:
    - percentage: 10
      duration: "1 day"
    - percentage: 50
      duration: "3 days"
    - percentage: 100
```

3. **Monitor Impact**
```yaml
monitoring:
  compareMetrics: true
  baseline: "last-30-days"
  alerts:
    - metric: "conversion-rate"
      changeThreshold: -5  # Alert if drops by 5%
```
