# AI Shopping Assistant Documentation Index

*Version: v1.0*  
*Last Updated: 25 June 2025*

This index provides a complete map of all documentation for the AI Shopping Assistant project.

## üìÇ Documentation Structure

The documentation is organized in the following locations:
- **`./docs/`** - Essential documentation for humans (7 focused guides)
- **`./docs/reference/`** - Comprehensive reference documentation (10 detailed guides, primarily for LLMs)
- **`./docs/imp/`** - Implementation working documents (internal tracking)
- **`./docs/external/`** - External source documents and strategic materials
- **`./docs/archive/`** - Archived documentation
- **`./docs/unified-data-model/`** - UDL technical specifications

### Why This Structure?
- **Humans** start with the 7 essential docs in `/docs/` - these are what you actually need to read
- **LLMs** can consume all 17 docs including the detailed references
- **Clear mental model**: Start simple, dive deep only when needed
