## Deployment Readiness

### Demo Mode ✅
- Fully functional with mock data
- All features working
- Performance targets met
- Can be deployed immediately

### Production Mode ⏸️
- Code is ready
- Needs backend configuration
- Requires API credentials
- Integration testing pending

### Infrastructure Requirements
```yaml
Frontend:
  - Next.js 14+ compatible hosting
  - SSE support (for streaming)
  - 2GB RAM minimum
  
Middleware:
  - Node.js 18+
  - Redis (optional, for caching)
  - 4GB RAM recommended
  
External:
  - OpenAI API access
  - Alokai Middleware configured
  - Commerce backend (SAP CC, etc.)
```

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk ✅
- Demo deployment
- Performance at scale
- Security vulnerabilities
- User experience

### Medium Risk ⚠️
- Backend integration complexity
- Token costs at high volume
- Cache invalidation strategies

### Mitigation in Place
