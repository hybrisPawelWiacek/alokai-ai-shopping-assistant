Average Bulk Operations/Day: 50
Average Messages/Operation: 8
Total Daily B2B Messages: 400

Token Calculation:
- Input: 400 Ã— 800 = 320,000 tokens
- Output: 400 Ã— 1,200 = 480,000 tokens
- Daily Cost: $3.20 + $14.40 = $17.60
- Monthly Cost: ~$528
```

## Cost Breakdown

| Feature | % of Total Usage | Monthly Cost (10K users) |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| Product Search | 40% | $160 |
| Cart Management | 20% | $80 |
| Comparisons | 15% | $60 |
| B2B Operations | 15% | $60 |
| General Q&A | 10% | $40 |

### By User Segment

| Segment | Users | Avg Monthly Cost/User | Total |
|---------|-------|---------------------|-------|
| Casual Browsers | 70% | $0.02 | $140 |
| Active Shoppers | 25% | $0.08 | $200 |
| B2B Buyers | 5% | $0.20 | $100 |

### Hourly Distribution

```
Peak Hours (10am-2pm, 6pm-9pm): 60% of traffic
Off-Peak: 40% of traffic

Cost Implications:
- Consider queuing during peak
- Offer reduced features during high load
- Premium tier for guaranteed response
```

## Optimization Strategies

### 1. Intelligent Caching

**Implementation:**
```typescript
const cacheConfig = {
  searchResults: { ttl: 300 }, // 5 minutes
  productDetails: { ttl: 3600 }, // 1 hour
  comparisons: { ttl: 1800 }, // 30 minutes
};
```

**Savings:** 40-60% reduction for repeated queries

### 2. Context Window Management

**Current Implementation:**
```typescript
const MAX_CONTEXT_MESSAGES = 10; // Sliding window
const MAX_TOKENS_PER_MESSAGE = 500;
```

**Savings:** 30% reduction in input tokens

### 3. Response Optimization

**Strategies:**
- Structured outputs reduce tokens by 20%
- Avoid verbose explanations
- Use references instead of repetition

**Example:**
```typescript
// Verbose (300 tokens)
"I found several laptops for you. The first one is..."

// Optimized (100 tokens)
"Found 5 laptops matching your criteria: [list]"
```

### 4. Model Selection

**Decision Matrix:**

| Use Case | Recommended Model | Reasoning |
|----------|------------------|-----------|
| Simple queries | GPT-3.5 Turbo | 20x cheaper, sufficient quality |
| Complex B2B | GPT-4 Turbo | Better reasoning for bulk ops |
| Product search | GPT-3.5 Turbo | Structured data, simple task |

**Implementation:**
```typescript
const modelSelector = (intent: string) => {
  if (intent === 'bulk_order' || intent === 'b2b_quote') {
    return 'gpt-4-turbo-preview';
  }
  return 'gpt-3.5-turbo';
};
```

### 5. Batch Processing

**For B2B Operations:**
```typescript
// Batch similar queries
const batchProcessor = {
  queueSize: 10,
  maxWaitTime: 1000, // 1 second
  process: async (queries) => {
    // Single API call for multiple queries
  }
};
```

**Savings:** 25% for bulk operations

## Monitoring & Alerts

### Cost Tracking Dashboard

```typescript
// Metrics to track
const metrics = {
  tokensUsed: { input: 0, output: 0 },
  costByHour: {},
  costByFeature: {},
  costByUser: {},
  cacheHitRate: 0
};
```

### Alert Thresholds

| Alert Type | Threshold | Action |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Daily Budget | 80% | Notify admin |
| Daily Budget | 100% | Switch to degraded mode |
| Hourly Spike | 3x average | Investigate |
| User Anomaly | 10x average | Rate limit |

### Cost Reports

**Daily Report Example:**
```
Date: 2025-06-26

## Budget Planning Guide

### Starter Budget ($100/month)
- ~2,500 active users
- Basic features only
- GPT-3.5 Turbo only
- Aggressive caching

### Growth Budget ($1,000/month)

- Mixed model usage
- Standard caching

### Enterprise Budget ($10,000/month)
- ~250,000 active users
- Premium features
- GPT-4 for complex queries
- Custom optimizations

## Cost Control Implementation

### 1. Rate Limiting
```typescript
const rateLimits = {
  b2c: { requests: 60, window: 60000 }, // 60/min
  b2b: { requests: 120, window: 60000 }, // 120/min
};
```

### 2. Graceful Degradation
```typescript
const degradedMode = {
  enabledAt: 0.9, // 90% of budget
  features: ['search', 'cart'], // Core only
  message: 'High demand - some features limited'
};
```

### 3. User Quotas
```typescript
const userQuotas = {
  free: { messages: 50, period: 'month' },
  premium: { messages: 500, period: 'month' },
  enterprise: { messages: -1 }, // Unlimited
};
```

## Recommendations

### Short Term (0-3 months)
1. Implement aggressive caching (40% cost reduction)
2. Use GPT-3.5 Turbo for 80% of queries
3. Set up cost monitoring dashboard
4. Implement rate limiting

### Medium Term (3-6 months)
1. Build intelligent model selection
2. Implement batch processing for B2B
3. Optimize prompts for token efficiency
4. Consider fine-tuned models

### Long Term (6+ months)
1. Evaluate self-hosted models for high-volume
2. Implement predictive pre-caching
3. Build cost allocation system
4. Consider hybrid approach (own model + OpenAI)

## Conclusion

The AI Shopping Assistant can operate profitably at various scales:
- **Small businesses**: $50-100/month for significant value
- **Medium businesses**: $400-1000/month with strong ROI
- **Enterprises**: $10K+/month as a competitive advantage

Key to success:
1. Start with aggressive optimization
2. Monitor and adjust continuously
3. Focus on high-value interactions
4. Scale gradually with revenue
