## setCustomerEmail

`setCustomerEmail` sets the email of the active customer. It requires the email and returns the updated `SfCart` object. If the email is not valid, an error will be thrown.

#### Usage

```ts
const cart = await sdk.unified.setCustomerEmail({
  email: "johndoe@example.com",
});

console.log(cart.customerEmail); // johndoe@example.com
```

#### Type

```ts
export type SetCustomerEmail = (args: SetCustomerEmailArgs) => Promise<SfCart>;

export interface SetCustomerEmailArgs {
  email: string;
}
```

## setCartAddress

`setCartAddress` sets the shipping address for the customer. It returns the updated `SfCart` object.

#### Usage

```ts
const cart = await sdk.unified.setCartAddress({
  shippingAddress: {
    address1: "Some Street",
    city: "New York",
    country: "United States",
    firstName: "John",
    lastName: "Doe",
    phoneNumber: "+12065550100",
    postalCode: "54-022",
    state: "NY",
    titleCode: "Mr",
  },
});
```

#### Existing Address

Commonly during the checkout process, the customer will have an existing address. In this case, you can use the `SfCustomerAddress` object to set the shipping address for the cart.

```ts
const { addresses } = await sdk.unified.getCustomerAddresses();
const cart = await sdk.unified.setCartAddress({
  shippingAddress: addresses[0],
});
```

#### Type

```ts
export type SetCartAddress = (args: SetShippingAddress) => Promise<SfCart>;

export interface SetShippingAddress {
  shippingAddress: SfCreateAddressBody | SfCustomerAddress;
}

export interface SfCreateAddressBody {
  address1: string;
  address2?: Maybe<string>;
  city: string;
  country: string;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  phoneNumber: string;
  postalCode: string;
  state: string;
  titleCode: string;
}

export interface SfCustomerAddress {
  id: SfId;
  address1: Maybe<string>;
  address2?: Maybe<string>;
  city: Maybe<string>;
  country: Maybe<string>;
  firstName: Maybe<string>;
  lastName: Maybe<string>;
  phoneNumber: Maybe<string>;
  postalCode: Maybe<string>;
  state: Maybe<string>;
  titleCode: Maybe<string>;
}
```

## getAvailableShippingMethods

`getAvailableShippingMethods` fetches the available shipping methods based on the customer's shipping address. It returns a list of `SfShippingMethods`.

```

#### Type

```ts
export type GetAvailableShippingMethods = () => Promise<SfShippingMethods>;

export interface SfShippingMethods {
  methods: SfShippingMethod[];
}

export interface SfShippingMethod {
  description: Maybe<string>;
  estimatedDelivery: Maybe<string>;
  id: string;
  name: string;
  price: SfMoney;
}
```

## setShippingMethod

`setShippingMethod` is used to select a shipping method from the available options. It requires the id of the chosen shipping method and returns the updated `SfCart` object.

#### Usage

```ts
const { methods } = await sdk.unified.getAvailableShippingMethods();
const updatedCart = await sdk.unified.setShippingMethod({
  shippingMethodId: methods[0]?.id,
});
```

#### Type

```ts
export type SetShippingMethod = (args: SetShippingMethodArgs) => Promise<SfCart>;

export interface SetShippingMethodArgs {
  shippingMethodId: string;
}
```
